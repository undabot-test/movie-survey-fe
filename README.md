## Project Structure

The project structure is an adaptation of the [angular structure](https://angular.io/guide/file-structure) and [atomic design ideas](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) to the realities of react.\
To put it simple, all view components are in the /components folder. Data & logic layer, API requests can be found in the /services folder.\
Ð¡omponents can be divided into several groups, the main ones are: /atoms, /molecules, /organisms, /templates, /pages.\
\
At the moment, network requests are simulated by the service worker.
